A library helps generate descriptive statistics tables. Namely, by providing a dataframe, it will be grouped by its categorical columns which are chosen by the user and output a table (generated by knitr::kable) which has the first column contains the labels of the group(s) and the rest columns represented the descriptive statistics the user asks for.
